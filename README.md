The Statistical Learning outcomes I had after Cleaning and Exploring the data are mainly the following:
>From the dataset we see that total 1869 people are churning overall with respect to 5174 people overall non churners.<br/>
>The ratio of people churning against not churning is 27:73.<br/>
>After grouping the data by the user service tenure we can see most people were customers for 1 year i.e. 2175 persons.<br/>
>Suprisingly they were followed by 5 to 6 years long customers numbered at 1407.<br/>

The basic goal of this project is to derive at final insights after exploring the dataset.
The main insights that I got after exploring the dataset are:-

1.Electronic check medium are the highest churners. <br/>
2.Contract Type - Monthly customers are more likely to churn because of no contract terms, as they are free to go customers. <br/>
3.No Online security, No Tech Support category are high churners. <br/>
4.Non-senior Citizens are high churners. <br/>
