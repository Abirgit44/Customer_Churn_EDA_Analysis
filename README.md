# Customer_Churn_Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to my project on Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction!

In this project, I've taken the Telecom Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights. Additionally, I've built predictive models using TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn.

## Skills Applied

Data Cleaning, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn.

## Churn Analysis Insights

Here are some key insights I gathered after cleaning and exploring the data:

- The dataset shows that a total of 1869 people are churning out of 5174 overall, resulting in a churn rate of approximately 27%.
- The majority of customers, about 73%, are non-churners.
- The distribution of customer service tenure reveals that the highest number of customers stayed for 1 year (2175 persons), followed by customers staying for 5 to 6 years (1407 persons).

## Model Building

I've also built predictive models to identify potential churners using the following approaches:

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow and Keras**: I used TensorFlow and Keras libraries to construct an ANN model. The model was trained on preprocessed data for churn prediction.
You can explore the web-based Churn Prediction Model that I've built using Streamlit. Check it out here: [Churn Prediction Web App](https://churnpredictionbyabir.streamlit.app/)

## Main Insights

The primary goal of this project is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset and build predictive models to identify potential churners. Here are some notable findings:

1. Customers using the Electronic check payment medium exhibit the highest churn rate.
2. Monthly contract customers are more likely to churn due to their lack of contract terms, allowing them to easily switch.
3. Categories with no Online Security or Tech Support tend to have higher churn rates.
4. Non-senior citizens are more likely to churn compared to senior citizens.
